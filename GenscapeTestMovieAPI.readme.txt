All the files included in this process (included some descriptions) are:

movie_api.py: 
    Python program contains the bulk of the code used to create a database,
    create Movie schema, populate the necessary default values,
    as well as handle both the collection and processing of themoviedb api.
    By running the program, this assumes the system used to process has 
    postgres installed with a default postgres database, as well as postgres
    user as a root like user available, with the password stored in pgpass.conf
    with the appropriate file/group privileges.  However, as long as postgres is 
    installed, any user with proper privileges (to create a database etc.) along
    with another server/database can be used, but there is some modification in
    the code which needs to be set for this to work.

movie_api_queries.py:
    This is not a stand alone Python program, but for readability/style, I have
    seperated out the queries executed in movie_api.py & movie_daily_process.py
    into this file.  I believe it still should be straightforward to understand
    how the movie_api.py program works without all the sql code in it.

movie_daily_process.py: 
    Python program which is meant to run daily to accomplish the goals 
    in the requirements. I did not provide any scheduling process info but if I 
    did I would have used chron. This falls out of the scope of requirements however.

createMovieSchema.sql:
    This is the DDL/SQL file used to create the movie schema.  This does not need to
    run seperately as the program executes this script as a part of creating the
    database, schema, and tables

sample_movie_queries.sql:
    Per the requirements, these are a set of queries developed to ensure that the
    system built could answer specific questions of the data collected in the database.
    When there was some ambiguity in the questions, there were comments made in the file
    so as to clarify assumptions in the requirements.

GenscapeTestMovieAPI.readme.txt:
    This file


The requirements for the operations of program are as follows:

1. You need Python 3 installed on your machine
2. You need the following libraries installed: 
  a) json
  b) requests
  c) psycopg2
  I believe everything else is standard Python libraries when you install Python 3.
3. Special Note -- I programmed this on a mac but believe it is OS agnostic.


To operate the process, download the files and install them into a working directory.
Make sure the user executing the programs have correct privileges with the files to execute.
There are two main steps, one step of the program needs to only run once (movie_api.py), where as the other
should be executed daily (movie_daily_process.py).

on the command line go to the directory where the programs have been installed.
execute the following line
python3 movie_api.py
This will build a GenscapeTest database, and create a movie schema with tables in it, 
as well as necessary default values.
This should only run once (although it can be run multiple times, it will just destroy 
any data stored in the database if you do!)

The other program executes similarly:
python3 movie_daily_process.py

This should run on a daily basis.  The requirements state that there needs a process to be run on
the first of the month, and this program contains the correct logic in order to accomplish that 
requirements.
